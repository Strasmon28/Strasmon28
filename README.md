I started using a computer at a very young age and eventually, I had gained a curiosity of how computers and technology in general worked.

Knowing the endless capabilities of tech, that inspired me to take up a career in the tech industry. So I decided to study both Computer Science and Computer Engineering, successfully earning a degree in both.

Later on, I decided to enroll in App Academy to build up and refine my skills to fit the demands for the industry.

Now, I currently work on my projects to keep them quality and refined to make some good impressions.
